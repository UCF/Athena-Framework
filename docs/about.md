The Athena Framework, part of the [Athena Project](https://ucf.github.io/Athena-Project/), is a front-end toolset for rapid development of websites and web applications which utilize [UCF's brand standards](https://www.ucf.edu/brand/).  It was developed out of necessity after UCF's rebranding initiative in 2016, which led to drastic visual changes in UCF's top-level websites.  The framework aims to provide a base set of styles and components that reduce repetitive front-end code and make it easy for the entire university to adhere to UCF's brand guidelines.

The Athena Framework, which refer to as just "Athena" in these docs, is written off of [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/).  Most features from Bootstrap 3/4 are carried over into Athena and should be familiar to developers that have used Bootstrap for other projects.

The Athena Framework is actively developed by [UCF Marketing's Web Communications team](https://www.ucf.edu/brand/contact-us/), but involvement and pull requests from the greater UCF development community are highly encouraged. See the [Community]({{ "/getting-started/introduction/#community" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) section of the docs for more information about getting involved.
