# Overview
The Athena Framework is a front-end framework built and used by the <a href="//brand.ucf.edu">UCF Marketing Team</a> to create responsive websites and web applications for <a href="//ucf.edu">UCF</a>. Based on <a href="//v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap 4,</a> the framework includes most of the functionality developers and content editors have come to expect of Bootstrap. In addition, base Bootstrap styles have been updated to conform to the UCF Brand by default, with additional variants for flexibility.
