Disabling [pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) can be particularly useful when combining media backgrounds and certain hover state setups.

{% example html %}
<a href="#">
  <div class="pointer-events-none">This is a child object within a link</div>
</a>
{% endexample %}
