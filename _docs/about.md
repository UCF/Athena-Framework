The Athena Framework, part of the [Athena Project](https://ucf.github.io/Athena-Project/), is a front-end toolset for rapid development of websites and web applications which utilize [UCF's brand standards](https://www.ucf.edu/brand/).  It was developed out of necessity after UCF's rebranding initiative in 2016, which led to drastic visual changes in UCF's top-level websites.  The framework aims to provide a base set of styles and components that reduce repetitive front-end code and make it easy for the entire university to adhere to UCF's brand guidelines.

The Athena Framework, which we refer to as just "Athena" in these docs, is written off of [Bootstrap 4 alpha 6](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/).  Most features from Bootstrap 3/4 are [carried over into Athena]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link migration.md %}) and should be familiar to developers that have used Bootstrap for other projects.


## Philosophy

Like Bootstrap 4, Athena is designed as a utility-based framework--meaning that highly-repetitive, frequently-used styles and logic have been condensed into single-purpose classes and components.  These single-purpose classes make it easy to rapidly develop prototypes and build highly-custom webpages without the need for writing custom CSS or JavaScript.  They also make it easier to duplicate similar design conventions across projects.


## Maintainers

The Athena Framework is actively developed by [UCF Marketing's Web Communications team](https://www.ucf.edu/brand/contact-us/), but involvement and pull requests from the greater UCF development community are [highly encouraged](#contributing).
